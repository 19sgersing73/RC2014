# RC2014
All about RC2014/Z80 in one place

This is my attempt to collect all the necessary information to build and program the 
RC2014 system...
 
All information is gathered from various websites. 

Should I violate copyright, please let me know.

All this information is based on Dr. Scott M. Baker's blog, only a bit polished :-)
